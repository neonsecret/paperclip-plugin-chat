# Plugin vs Core: Chat Feature Analysis

**Audience:** OSS team
**Date:** 2026-03-10
**Branch:** `plugin/chat-ui`

---

## Context

We built a full chat UI as a Paperclip plugin (`paperclip-chat`) to test whether the plugin system can support primary user-facing features. This document captures what worked, what didn't, and the hard boundaries we hit — so the team can make an informed build-vs-plugin decision for chat and similar features.

## The Core Problem

Chat and Paperclip agents are fundamentally different interaction models. Chat is synchronous, conversational, and user-driven — the user sends a message, the model responds, back and forth. Paperclip agents are autonomous, task-oriented, and system-driven — they receive a goal, execute multi-step plans, call tools, and report back when done. An agent session doesn't distinguish between "answer this question" and "go execute this task." It runs the same pipeline either way: full tool access, multi-step reasoning, autonomous execution. There's no "just respond to this message" mode.

This means a simple question like "what's 2+2?" goes through the same execution path as "create a sprint plan and assign tasks to all agents" — the overhead is identical, and the plugin has no way to tell the agent to behave differently.

The plugin system has no direct LLM access. A chat plugin's only path to an LLM is `ctx.agents.sessions.*` — which creates conversational sessions with **existing agents**. This creates a hard dependency chain:

1. An operator must manually create a compatible agent outside the plugin (e.g., "Chat Assistant")
2. The plugin discovers that agent by name or role using fragile heuristics (`agents.list()` → filter by adapter type → match by hardcoded name)
3. The plugin creates a session with that agent and sends messages through it
4. The agent runs in its full task-execution mode regardless of whether the user asked a simple question
5. The plugin cannot create agents, configure their instructions, select models, or control any aspect of the LLM interaction

**The plugin doesn't talk to a model. It talks to an agent that happens to talk to a model.** This indirection means the chat experience is entirely outside the plugin's control — it depends on how the agent was configured, what tools it has, and what system prompt it was given. The plugin is a UI wrapper around someone else's agent setup.

A core chat page would have direct adapter access — pick a model, provide a system prompt, send messages, stream the response. No agent abstraction, no pre-configuration dependency, no fragile name matching.

---

## Plugin Security Model

The plugin system implements defense-in-depth with multiple overlapping enforcement layers. This is the correct security posture for third-party extensions — and it's precisely why chat doesn't fit as a plugin.

### What the sandbox enforces

| Layer | Mechanism | Enforcement point |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Process isolation | Each plugin runs in a dedicated child process via `fork()` | `plugin-worker-manager.ts` |
| Capability gating | Every worker→host RPC call checked against 44 operation-to-capability mappings | `host-client-factory.ts`, `plugin-capability-validator.ts` |
| State isolation | `pluginId` is part of every state query — one plugin cannot read another's data | `plugin-state-store.ts` |
| Session ownership | Agent sessions scoped by `taskKey` pattern (`plugin:{pluginKey}:session:{uuid}`) | `plugin-host-services.ts` |
| Company boundaries | Every entity access verified against `companyId` before returning data | `plugin-host-services.ts` (`inCompany()`) |
| Module sandboxing | Allow-listed imports, relative imports constrained to plugin root, no access to host globals | `plugin-runtime-sandbox.ts` |
| Network protection | Protocol whitelist (http/https only), private IP blocking (RFC 1918, loopback, link-local, AWS metadata), DNS rebinding prevention | `plugin-host-services.ts` |
| Environment isolation | Minimal env vars (`PATH`, `NODE_PATH`, `NODE_ENV`, `TZ`, `PAPERCLIP_PLUGIN_ID`) — no `DATABASE_URL` or secrets | `plugin-worker-manager.ts` |
| Resource limits | 5-minute hard timeout per RPC call, crash recovery with exponential backoff (max 10 consecutive crashes) | `plugin-worker-manager.ts` |

A capability violation returns a `CapabilityDeniedError` (403). A company access violation returns "entity not found." A module import outside the allow-list is rejected at load time. These boundaries are enforced at every level before reaching data services.

### Why this matters for chat

This sandbox is well-designed for what plugins should be: **additive extensions that operate within defined boundaries.** A Linear sync plugin reads issues and writes state. A Slack notification plugin subscribes to events and makes outbound HTTP requests. These fit naturally within the capability model.

Chat needs to operate outside these boundaries. The capabilities required to build a proper chat experience — direct LLM access, process execution, agent creation, model selection — each punch a hole in the sandbox. Widening the plugin security model to accommodate chat would weaken it for every other plugin. The alternative (keeping the sandbox tight) means chat will always be a constrained, indirect experience mediated through agent sessions the plugin doesn't control.

**The plugin sandbox is the right scope for plugins. Chat needs a wider scope. The answer is to build chat where that wider scope is natural (core), not to widen the sandbox.**

## Plugin System Capabilities (What Plugins CAN Do)

The plugin SDK (`PluginContext`) exposes these APIs to worker code:

| API | Purpose | Capabilities Required |
|-----|---------|----------------------|
| `ctx.config` | Read operator config | — |
| `ctx.state` | Key-value storage (company/instance/user scoped) | `plugin.state.read/write` |
| `ctx.events` | Subscribe to / emit domain events | `events.subscribe/emit` |
| `ctx.jobs` | Register scheduled jobs | `jobs.schedule` |
| `ctx.http` | Outbound HTTP requests | `http.outbound` |
| `ctx.secrets` | Resolve secret references | `secrets.read-ref` |
| `ctx.assets` | Read/write file assets | `assets.read/write` |
| `ctx.activity` | Write activity log entries | `activity.log.write` |
| `ctx.entities` | CRUD plugin-owned entity records | — |
| `ctx.projects` | Read project/workspace metadata | `projects.read` |
| `ctx.companies` | Read company metadata | `companies.read` |
| `ctx.issues` | Read/write issues and comments | issue capabilities |
| `ctx.agents` | List/get/pause/resume/invoke agents | `agents.read/pause/resume/invoke` |
| `ctx.agents.sessions` | Create sessions, send messages, stream events | `agent.sessions.*` |
| `ctx.goals` | Read/mutate goals | `goals.read/create/update` |
| `ctx.data` | Register `getData` handlers for UI | — |
| `ctx.actions` | Register `performAction` handlers for UI | — |
| `ctx.streams` | Push real-time events to UI via SSE | — |
| `ctx.tools` | Register agent tool handlers | `agent.tools.register` |
| `ctx.metrics` | Write plugin metrics | `metrics.write` |
| `ctx.logger` | Structured logging | — |
| `ctx.launchers` | Register launcher UI entry points | — |

The UI bridge exposes these hooks to plugin frontend code:

| Hook | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `usePluginData(key)` | Fetch data from worker `getData` handler | Working |
| `usePluginAction(key)` | Call worker `performAction` handler | Working |
| `useHostContext()` | Get company/project/user IDs | Working |
| `usePluginStream(channel)` | Subscribe to SSE stream from worker | **Declared but not implemented** |

UI components (`MetricCard`, `StatusBadge`, `MarkdownBlock`, `Spinner`, etc.) are registered as **non-functional stubs** — they render placeholder `<div>` elements.

---

## Hard Boundaries (What Plugins CANNOT Do)

### 1. No Agent Creation

Plugins can interact with existing agents (`list`, `get`, `pause`, `resume`, `invoke`) and create conversational sessions with them (`sessions.create`, `sessions.sendMessage`). But there is **no `agents.create()` API** — agents must be created outside the plugin system.

The core `agentService.create()` exists server-side but is not wired to the plugin JSON-RPC protocol.

**Impact on chat:** The chat plugin requires a pre-existing "Chat Assistant" agent. It can't programmatically provision or configure agents per-workspace.

### 2. No Direct LLM / Adapter Access

There is no `ctx.chat`, `ctx.llm`, or `ctx.adapters` API. All LLM access goes through agent sessions, which are designed for task execution:

- Every message creates or resumes an agent session with its own `agents.md` system prompt
- No way to select models, set temperature, or customize system prompts per-thread
- The agent abstraction adds indirection that doesn't fit conversational chat

**What chat actually needs:** `ctx.chat.stream(adapterType, model, messages)` — pick a model, send messages, get a stream back.

### 3. No Process Execution

There is no `ctx.exec()`, `ctx.spawn()`, or any shell/process API. Plugins cannot:

- Run CLI tools (Claude CLI, Codex, OpenCode, etc.)
- Spawn background processes
- Execute arbitrary binaries

The only way to run an LLM process is through the host's agent adapter system, which the plugin has no control over.

### 4. No Design System Access

Plugin UI bundles run in an isolated ESM scope. Bridge components are stubs:

```
MetricCard    → renders [MetricCard]
StatusBadge   → renders [StatusBadge]
MarkdownBlock → renders [MarkdownBlock]
Spinner       → renders [Spinner]
```

The chat plugin had to rewrite its entire UI with inline styles — no design tokens, no Tailwind, no `lucide-react` icons, no theme consistency with the host app. We use CSS custom properties (`var(--border)`, `var(--accent)`, etc.) that happen to inherit from the host, but this is fragile and undocumented.

### 5. No Host UI APIs

| API | What it enables | Plugin access |
|-----|-----------------|---------------|
| `useToast()` | Success/error notifications | None |
| `useDialog()` | Confirmation modals | None |
| `useRouter()` | Navigate to issues/projects/agents | None |
| `useBreadcrumbs()` | "Chat > Thread Name" navigation | None |
| `useSidebar()` | Collapse host sidebar for full-width chat | None |

### 6. No Sub-Routes or Deep Linking

Plugin pages route to `/:companyPrefix/plugins/:pluginId` (UUID). There is no sub-routing — no `/chat/thread/:threadId` URLs.

- Refreshing the page loses the selected thread
- Users can't share links to specific conversations
- Browser back/forward doesn't work within the plugin

### 7. Streaming Bridge Not Wired

The SSE backend is fully implemented (`ctx.streams.open/emit/close`, stream bus, SSE endpoint). The `usePluginStream()` hook is declared in the SDK and registered in `bridge-init.ts`, but has **no concrete implementation** in `bridge.ts`. This is ~60 lines of code to fix.

**Impact today:** Chat plugin polls every 1.5s for new messages. Users see chunked text instead of token-by-token streaming.

### 8. UUID-Only User Identity

`useHostContext()` provides `userId` as a UUID. No user name, email, or avatar URL. The chat plugin shows "U" as the user avatar because it has no way to get the user's display name.

### 9. No Agent Configuration Access

The plugin SDK exposes no API for reading or writing agent instructions, system prompts, adapter config, or model selection. `ctx.agents` only provides read-only metadata (`list`, `get`) and control operations (`pause`, `resume`, `invoke`). This means:

- The plugin can't customize the agent's behavior per-thread or per-conversation
- No way to set a system prompt like "You are a helpful chat assistant" — the agent's `agents.md` takes over entirely
- No model picker — agents have a single `adapterType` with no exposed model list, and `sessions.sendMessage()` has no model override parameter
- The chat experience is entirely dependent on how the agent was manually configured outside the plugin

**Model selection is a dead feature in the plugin.** The `adapters` data handler calls `ctx.agents.list()`, deduplicates by `adapterType`, and returns adapter options — but always with `models: []` because there's no API to discover what models an adapter supports. The model is determined internally by the agent's adapter config (e.g., what's in `agents.md`). Even if we hardcoded a model list or made it operator-configurable via `instanceConfigSchema`, `sessions.sendMessage()` has no model parameter — the plugin can't pass a model choice through to the agent. The plugin settings page (auto-generated from `instanceConfigSchema`) could expose model options, but they'd be cosmetic only.

### 10. Agent Sessions Are Task-Oriented, Not Conversational

The plugin's only path to LLM access is `ctx.agents.sessions.*`, which creates sessions with existing agents. These sessions are designed for task execution (give an agent work, watch it run tools), not conversational chat. The mismatch shows up in practice:

**Current agent selection logic (fragile):**
1. List all agents in the company
2. Filter by `adapterType` matching the thread's adapter
3. Hardcoded preference: find agent named `"Chat Assistant"` → fallback to role `"general"` → fallback to first match
4. Create a session with that agent

**Problems:**
- Magic string dependency on an agent named "Chat Assistant" — breaks if renamed or deleted
- Every conversation routes to the same agent regardless of user intent
- The agent's autonomous execution mode (tool calls, multi-step reasoning) runs even for simple Q&A
- No way to differentiate "chat mode" from "task mode" — the agent behaves the same either way
- Letting users chat with specific agents (CEO, Engineer, etc.) is mechanically possible via the sessions API, but those agents are configured for task execution, not conversation — their system prompts, tools, and behavior don't adapt to a chat context

**What chat actually needs:** A lightweight conversational API — pick a model, provide a system prompt, send messages, stream the response. No agent abstraction, no task execution overhead, no dependency on pre-configured agents.

### 11. No Plugin Page Chrome Control

The host's `PluginPage.tsx` wraps all plugin pages with breadcrumbs ("Plugins > Chat") and a "Back" button. There is no manifest option or bridge API to suppress or customize this wrapper. Plugins that want a full-screen, immersive experience (like chat) are stuck with navigation chrome that doesn't fit.

---

## What We Had to Build Around

These are the workarounds we implemented in the plugin to compensate for missing platform features:

| Gap | Workaround | Cost |
|-----|-----------|------|
| No streaming | Poll `getData` every 1.5s, buffer chunks in worker state | Choppy UX, wasted requests |
| No design system | ~400 lines of inline CSS with `var()` fallbacks | Fragile, doesn't match host exactly |
| No markdown renderer | Bundle our own (basic regex-based) | Missing features vs host's `MarkdownBlock` |
| No toast API | Silent failures, `console.error` only | Users don't know when things break |
| No sub-routes | Thread selection is component state | Lost on refresh, no shareable URLs |
| No agent creation | Pre-provision a "Chat Assistant" agent manually | Can't self-configure on install |
| No user identity | Show "U" avatar, no display name | Impersonal chat experience |
| No deep linking | Thread IDs stored in plugin state only | No URL-based thread access |
| No agent config access | Hardcode agent name "Chat Assistant", hope it exists | Can't customize system prompt or behavior |
| Task-oriented sessions | Agent runs in full execution mode for simple Q&A | Unnecessary tool calls, slow responses |
| No model discovery | Model picker is dead code, always empty | Users can't choose models |
| Host page chrome | Can't hide breadcrumbs or back button | Wasted vertical space, non-immersive |

---

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Capability | Plugin Chat (Current) | Core Chat Page |
|------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Token streaming | 1.5s polling | Native SSE, token-by-token |
| LLM access | Agent sessions only (indirect) | Direct adapter API, model selection |
| Process execution | None | Can spawn CLI tools directly |
| Design system | Inline styles, CSS var hacks | Full component library, design tokens |
| Error feedback | `console.error` | Toast notifications |
| Confirm dialogs | None | Native dialog system |
| Navigation | Trapped in plugin slot | Link to issues, projects, agents |
| Routing | `/plugins/:uuid` | `/chat`, `/chat/:threadId` |
| Breadcrumbs | None | "Chat > Thread Name" |
| Markdown rendering | Custom inline renderer | Host's `MarkdownBlock` |
| User identity | UUID only, "U" avatar | Full user profile, avatar |
| State persistence | Plugin key-value store | Dedicated DB tables, indexed queries |
| Thread sharing | No deep links | Shareable URLs |
| Agent provisioning | Manual, pre-existing agent required | Programmatic creation |
| Agent selection | Hardcoded name match ("Chat Assistant") | Direct adapter API, no agent needed |
| Agent configuration | No access to instructions/config | Full control over system prompt, tools |
| Model selection | Dead feature — no model discovery API | Direct model picker per-thread |
| Conversation vs task | Agent sessions (task-oriented) | Lightweight chat API |
| Page chrome | Host-controlled breadcrumbs + back button | Full layout control |
| Keyboard shortcuts | Limited to textarea | Global shortcut registration |
| Security boundary | Sandboxed: process isolation, capability-gated RPC, state partitioning | Trusted: full server access, direct DB, no capability checks |
| LLM cost control | Mediated through agent sessions (host controls spending) | Direct adapter access (must implement own cost controls) |
| Data access scope | Only declared capabilities, only enabled companies | Full database access, all companies |

## What Would Need to Change to Keep Chat as a Plugin

Ordered by impact on the plugin's featureset:

### Unblocks real-time streaming
1. **Implement `usePluginStream()` in bridge.ts** — the SSE backend is complete, the frontend hook is missing. Without this, the plugin polls every 1.5s instead of streaming token-by-token.

### Unblocks native look-and-feel
2. **Implement bridge UI components** — replace stubs with real `MarkdownBlock`, `Spinner`, `DataTable`. Without this, every plugin rebuilds basic UI from scratch with inline styles.
3. **Add `useToast()` and `useDialog()` to the bridge** — without this, plugins have no way to show error feedback or confirmation prompts.
4. **Expose user display info** in `useHostContext()` (name, email, avatar URL) — without this, chat can't show real user identity.
5. **Expose design tokens** — document which CSS custom properties plugins can rely on. Without this, theme integration is guesswork.
6. **Plugin page chrome control** — allow plugins to opt out of the host's breadcrumbs/back button wrapper. Without this, immersive UIs like chat waste vertical space on navigation that doesn't fit.

### Unblocks proper navigation
7. **Route by plugin key** — `PluginPage.tsx` should match by key or UUID. Without this, plugin URLs are fragile UUIDs that break on reinstall.
8. **Plugin sub-routes** — `/plugins/:id/*` with plugin-controlled routing. Without this, no deep linking, no shareable thread URLs, no browser back/forward.

### Unblocks direct LLM access (changes the plugin security model)
9. **Direct adapter/chat API** — `ctx.chat.stream(adapter, model, messages)` bypassing agent sessions. Without this, all LLM access is mediated through task-oriented agent sessions with no control over model, system prompt, or behavior.
10. **Model discovery and passthrough** — expose available models per adapter and accept a model parameter on `sessions.sendMessage()`. Without this, the model selector is dead code.
11. **Agent creation API** — `ctx.agents.create()` so plugins can provision their own agents. Without this, plugins depend on manually pre-configured agents.
12. **Process execution API** — `ctx.exec()` for controlled CLI access. Without this, plugins can't use external LLM tools (Claude CLI, Codex, OpenCode).

Items 9-12 fundamentally change the plugin security model. They're not incremental fixes — each one breaks a specific sandbox boundary:

| Item | Sandbox boundary it breaks |
|------|---------------------------|
| `ctx.chat.stream()` | Bypasses agent capability system — plugin gets raw LLM access with no mediation. Host loses visibility into what prompts are being sent, what models are being used, and what costs are being incurred. |
| Model discovery | Exposes infrastructure configuration (which models are deployed, which API keys are active) to plugin code running in an isolated process. |
| `ctx.agents.create()` | Plugin creates autonomous entities with their own permissions, tools, and system prompts. An agent created by a plugin inherits the host's execution environment — it can run tools, spawn processes, and access resources the plugin itself cannot. |
| `ctx.exec()` | Plugin escapes its process sandbox entirely. A plugin with shell access can read the filesystem, access environment variables, reach internal networks, and execute arbitrary code on the host machine. |

The current sandbox is well-enforced: capability-gated RPC, process isolation, state partitioning, SSRF protection, module allow-listing. Adding these capabilities doesn't just expand the plugin's feature surface — it undermines the security properties that make the plugin system safe for third-party code.

---

## Recommendation

Chat is a primary user interaction surface. The plugin system is designed for **extensions** — third-party integrations, custom dashboards, workflow automations. Chat needs:

- Direct LLM access with model selection and streaming
- Full design system integration
- First-class routing and navigation
- The ability to reference and link to entities across the app
- User identity for personalization

The security model reinforces this conclusion. The plugin sandbox enforces process isolation, capability-gated RPC, state partitioning, and network protection — all appropriate constraints for third-party code. Chat requires capabilities (direct LLM access, process execution, agent creation) that would break these boundaries. Widening the sandbox to accommodate chat weakens it for every plugin. Building chat as core code means it operates in the trusted server context where these capabilities are natural, while the plugin sandbox stays tight for third-party extensions.

**Build chat as a core page.** The plugin implementation proved the UX works and validated the interaction model. Port the patterns (thread CRUD, slash commands, streaming, sidebar) into a core `Chat.tsx` page with full host access.

**Keep the plugin system for what it's good at:** Linear sync, Slack notifications, custom metric dashboards, third-party tool integrations — features that are additive and don't need deep host coupling. The sandbox is an asset for these use cases, not a limitation.

---

## What the Plugin Experiment Validated

Not all the work is throwaway. These patterns transfer directly to a core implementation:

- Thread CRUD model (create, list, rename, delete, archive)
- Slash command system with keyboard navigation
- Message streaming and incremental rendering
- Welcome screen → thread → message flow
- Collapsible sidebar with thread search
- Auto-resize textarea input
- Error segment rendering in message streams
- Issue reference linking in messages (`#123` → issue link)

The plugin version is a working prototype. The core version inherits the UX and loses the workarounds.
